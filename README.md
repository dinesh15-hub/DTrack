# DTrack â€” Personal CLI Assistant

Hey there! Iâ€™m Dinesh, a passionate coder building my own **personal CLI assistant** called **DTrack**. This project helps me keep track of my daily work and goals in a simple, no-fuss way â€” all from the command line.

---

## What can DTrack do?

- **Log Todayâ€™s Work:** Quickly jot down what you worked on today.
- **View All Logs:** See all your past work logs anytime.
- **Add Goals:** Set short-term goals to stay focused.
- **View Goals:** Check your active goals and track progress.
- **Mark Goals Completed:** Celebrate your wins by marking goals done.

## Why I built this

As a student and developer, I like to stay organized but hate complicated apps. I wanted a lightweight, easy-to-use tool that works right from the terminal â€” no distractions, no overkill. Plus, itâ€™s a great way to practice Java and file handling.

## How to use

1. Clone this repo or download the files.
2. Compile the Java files:
    ```
    javac *.java
    ```
3. Run the app:
    ```
    java DTrack
    ```
4. Follow the on-screen menu to log work, add goals, and manage your productivity.

## Future plans

Iâ€™m planning to add a **Reminder System** next â€” so you never miss important tasks. Also, thinking about adding a GUI version someday!

## Feedback & Contributions

Iâ€™m always open to ideas and improvements. Feel free to open issues or suggest features!

Thanks for checking out my project. Letâ€™s keep coding and tracking those goals! ðŸš€
